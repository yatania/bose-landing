Technologies Used:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): In this project, HTML is used to define the layout of the landing page, including sections for the header, main content, product details, and contact form. Semantic tags help enhance accessibility and SEO.

SCSS (Sassy CSS): SCSS is used in this project to create a consistent and efficient styling framework. It helps manage complex styles by organizing them into reusable components, applying themes, and enabling easier modifications through variables.

JavaScript: In this project, JavaScript is used to implement animations that occur when elements appear in the viewport as the user scrolls. The Intersection Observer API is leveraged to trigger CSS animations, enhancing the user experience.

Google Fonts: The Inter font is imported from Google Fonts to ensure a modern and visually appealing text style that aligns with the site's design.

Responsive Design Techniques: Media queries and flexible grid layouts are used to adapt the layout and styles for different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices.

These technologies together create a robust, visually appealing, and interactive landing page that effectively showcases the speakers brand and engages users.
